  - **Impact**: Prevents full service stack from starting
  - **Recommendation**: Update to compatible LightRAG version

#### 2. Configuration Issues
- **Missing Environment Variables**: 
  - Several optional variables not set (DOC_PROCESSOR_MODEL, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
  - **Impact**: Warning messages during service startup
  - **Status**: Non-critical, services can start with defaults

#### 3. Test Environment Setup
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - ✅ Environment file path resolution
  - ✅ Docker Compose command syntax
  - ✅ Script variable scope issues
  - ✅ Authentication parameter handling
